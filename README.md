In the analysis of Pyschool we made dataframes in the summary pertaining per schools with columns of summaries from Counts of schools, Types of School, Total School Budget, Per Student Budget, Averge of Math and Reading scores, Math and Reading pass %, and Overall % Passing:

-From this dataframe we went on by finding the highest performing schools and lowest and making them in a sorted data structure 
-Then we took the math and reading scores of 9-12 graders and made a dataframe in which showed all the passing grades with the schools.
-After that we took the student budget from each school and created a data frame from grouping them in the budget desired amount 
-Then we did the same and found the school size by making them in a group and setting a label of small, medium, and large
-We also did this for Types of schools lastly and got the average score for each types of schools such as Charter and District.


In conclusion, performance of Reading scores was higher throughout each school and grade level with all passing with an 80% or higher. For spending of schools district schools had a higher school budget and students passed at the highest raate when they had a budget of 585-630. Charter schools tended to end up with a higher passing rate for both math and reading categories.
